# Unigon-project
Unigon project for Gamedev class

## Gamplay
The basic gameplay loop of Unigon can be broken down into two parts: Dodge, and Survive the timer. The player will enter the level and immediately start dodging the obstacles that approach.

## Features and ToDos
[x] == Done \
[_] == ToDo
### Gameplay:
- [x] Basic movement
- [_] Advanced movement (Special moves, etc.)
- [x] obstacle generation: This feature was the most work on and its future proof with posibilities to generate obstacles in a more advanced and modular way.
- [x] Basic level generation
- [_] Advanced level generation (Set Patterns, etc.)

The basic gameplay loop is complete. The player can move and avoid obstacles. Obstacles are generated in a modular way, so that we can add more obstacles in the future with pseudo-randomly generated set patterns.

### UI:
- [x] Basic UI (Main Menu, and DeathScreen)
- [_] Advanced UI (Score, etc.)
- [_] UI fixes (UI scaling, etc.)

### Audio:
- [x] Basic audio (Track 1 done, and Simple SFX)

## Weekly Progress
Done with most of the Core mechanics, and the basic UI. There was a focus on the core mechanics and how the game will be built, like the building blocks for the future. The game is playable, but there is still a lot of work to be done.
